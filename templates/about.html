        <p style="color: #ebebeb; font-size: large;"> Most floods take hours or even days to develop, giving residents ample time to prepare or evacuate. Others
            generate quickly and with little warning. These flash floods can be extremely dangerous, instantly turning a
            babbling brook into a thundering wall of water and sweeping everything in its path downstream.
            <br>
            Flood depends on the complex mixture of rainfall, soil moisture and the recent history of precipitation.
            Snowmelts and storm surges can also contribute to unexpected floods.
