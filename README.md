<b>Auxilior</b>
<br>
<br>
We are focusing on the predictions and management part of the theme. <br>
So, this project basically comprises of a Web App, which will show various data related to disaster. As we all know, we can't really predict for sure the time and place of disasters. But, it is well known that a good contingency plan and preventive measures could save a lot of lives.
<br>
<br>
In the prototype, we will only have a working system for floods.In the case of floods, we can have the following:-
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Map showing danger zones.
<li> Regular monitoring of the risk of flooding using information from volunteers and india-water.gov.in portal.
<li> Utilizing social media like twitter for detecting floods.
<li> Automatically posting warning on our facebook page 'Auxilior' in case of emergency.
<li> Analyzing tweets to gather information about needs and offers of resources during and after disaster.
<li> Sending SMS and emails to subscribed users about predictions and other updates.
<li> Sending warning and suggestions to stakeholders through email.
</ul>
